Algorithm::RandomPointGenerator generates a set of random points in a 2D plane
according to a user-specified probability distribution that is supplied as a 2D
histogram.

The quickest way to use the module is through the script genRand2D that you'll
find in the examples subdirectory.  You can move this script to any convenient
location in your directory structure.  Call this script as a command-line
utility in the following manner:

  genRand2D  --histfile  your_histogram_file.csv  --bbfile  your_bounding_box_file.csv

where the '--histfile' option supplies the name of the file that contains a 2D
histogram and the option '--bbfile' the name of the file that defines a bounding
box in the XY-plane to which the histogram applies. The module uses the
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to draw random points from a probability density
function that is approximated by the 2D histogram you supply through the
'--histfile' option. You can also run the command
                                                                                                         genRand2D  --help  

for further information regarding these two command-line options.

This module requires the following three modules:

   List::Util
   Graphics::GnuplotIF
   Math::Big
   Math::Random
   File::Basename

For installation, do the usual

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

if you have root access.  If not, 

    perl Makefile.PL prefix=/some/other/directory/
    make
    make test
    make install
